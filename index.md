**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter**

This quarter, the most interesting topic has been combining Large Language Models with Reinforcement Learning to perform advanced reasoning. Specifically, looking at how a model can be used as both the generator and teacher model to effectively teach itself how to solve problems is akin to human thought and very interesting.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

One potential investigation would be to apply these reinforcement learning paradigms to multi-modal large language models which has not been done much before.

**3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

This quarter, we spent most of our time going over literature rather than trying our own experiments. Although this process is necessary to understand the current state of research, it would be nice to do more actual experiementation ourselves.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

In addition to LLMs, I would be interested in using some kind of web agents or other agent to explore and feed into the models.
